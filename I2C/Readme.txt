I have a confession and I have something to say. This I2C peripheral driver developing
was very complex I think. All the macros and finctions are not absolutely written by me sometimes
I had to take help of Examples developed by my instructor or teacher. Some functions are exactly
copied and modified in this I2C Driver. I2C is a complex thing! But in my SPI, GPIO and Delay drivers or
libraries development I had written all most of the code. I'm just saying no intention.

Since I'm writting this text I have developed GPIO, SPI, Delay and I2C Driver using CMSIS API. 
My Delay, SPI and GPIO drivers are tested with Hardware but this time in the case of I2C I don't have 
much time to test. So it's not tested by hardware yet. But I believe It will work! 

And I'm going to give credit to my instructor for teaching me such great things!
