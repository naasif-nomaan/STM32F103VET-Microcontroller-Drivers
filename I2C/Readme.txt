I have a confession and I have something to say. This I2C peripheral driver developing was very complex I think. All the macros and finctions are not absolutely written by me sometimes I had to take help of Examples developed by my instructor or teacher. Some functions are exactly copied and modified in this I2C Driver. I2C is a complex thing! But I had written all most of the code. I'm just saying with no intention.
